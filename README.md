Hi, I'm Bhumika!

🎨 I design pixels, 💻 wrangle code, and 💥 occasionally break things just to see how they tick.<br>
🎯 UI/UX junkie in training — because if it isn’t ✨ sexy and usable, what’s the point?<br>

🪄 Right now I’m deep into web magic, but my eyes 👀 are already wandering toward 🐍 Python, 🤖 AI sorcery, and 🎮 building games that ruin friendships (looking at you, Mario Party).<br>

⚡ I code like I live — a bit wild 🐅, full of experiments 🧪, and always pushing the limits 🚀 of what’s “normal.”<br>
